# Stage 1: Build the React app
FROM node:18 as build

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the built app with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output to the Nginx HTML directory
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the frontend port (e.g., 80)
EXPOSE 80

# Nginx will automatically serve the static content, so no CMD is needed
